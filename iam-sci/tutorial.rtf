Certainly! Here’s a **brief, practical guide** for editing each Terraform file to target a new environment (e.g., staging, prod, a different OpenStack cloud, or a different project/customer):

---

### 1. `provider.tf`
**What it does:**  
Defines which OpenStack cloud and region to use.

**How to edit for new environment:**  
- **No need to edit this file** directly for new environments if you’re using variables (`os_cloud_name`, `os_region_name`).
- Instead, ensure your new environment’s `.tfvars` file has the correct values:
    ```hcl
    os_cloud_name  = "new-cloud"
    os_region_name = "new-region"
    ```

---

### 2. `variables.tf`
**What it does:**  
Declares all variables your configuration uses.

**How to edit for new environment:**  
- **Usually, do NOT edit this file** for new environments.
- Only update if you add/remove/change variables for all environments.

---

### 3. `workspace-tfvars/dev-sms-L-sci.tfvars`  
**(You will duplicate and rename this file, e.g., `prod-app-L-sci.tfvars`)**

**What it does:**  
Defines all variable values for a specific environment.

**How to edit for new environment:**  
- **Duplicate and rename the file** for each new environment.
- Edit values for:
    - `os_cloud_name`, `os_region_name` (new cloud/region)
    - `project_name`, `domain_id`, `image_name`, `flavor_name`, `keypair_name`
    - Any tags (`owner`, `environment`, etc.)
    - Network CIDRs, subnets, DNS, etc.
    - IAM values (group names, admin details)
- Example for prod:
    ```hcl
    os_cloud_name = "prod-cloud"
    os_region_name = "eu-west-2"
    project_name = "prod-app"
    environment = "prod"
    owner = "alice"
    # ...and so on
    ```

---

### 4. `network.tf`
**What it does:**  
Defines networks, subnets, routers, and ports.

**How to edit for new environment:**  
- **No need to edit the file itself** for a new environment if networks/subnets are parameterized.
- Just update the `.tfvars` file with new CIDRs, DNS, or network names as needed.

---

### 5. `security_groups.tf`
**What it does:**  
Defines security groups and rules.

**How to edit for new environment:**  
- **Usually no need to edit** unless you want different rules (e.g., more restrictive SSH in prod).
- To tighten/loosen rules, edit this file directly.

---

### 6. `compute.tf`
**What it does:**  
Defines servers, floating IPs, and their associations.

**How to edit for new environment:**  
- **No need to edit for new environments** if parameters like `image_name`, `flavor_name`, etc. are in your `.tfvars`.
- **Edit the file** if you want a different server count, naming, or network attachment logic in the new environment.

---

### 7. `keystone.tf`
**What it does:**  
Handles IAM/project/federation assignments.

**How to edit for new environment:**  
- **No need to edit** unless group/role logic changes.
- Use different group/role variable values in your new `.tfvars` file as needed.

---

### 8. `outputs.tf`
**What it does:**  
Prints resource IDs and info after apply.

**How to edit for new environment:**  
- **Rarely needs editing.**  
- Only change if you want to add/remove outputs.

## **Summary Table**

| File                | Do you edit for new env? | Typical change for new env                   |
|---------------------|:-----------------------:|----------------------------------------------|
| provider.tf         |           ❌            | Use new values in tfvars                     |
| variables.tf        |           ❌            | Only if global variable definitions change   |
| *.tfvars            |           ✅            | **Yes — always duplicate & edit this file**  |
| network.tf          |           ❌            | Use new values in tfvars                     |
| security_groups.tf  |      Optional           | Edit for rule/policy changes only            |
| compute.tf          |      Optional           | Edit for instance count/type changes         |
| keystone.tf         |      Optional           | Edit for IAM logic changes only              |
| outputs.tf          |           ❌            | Only for different outputs                   |

## **How to create a new environment:**
1. **Copy** your `.tfvars` file, rename it (e.g., `prod-app-L-sci.tfvars`).
2. **Edit the new file** for all environment-specific values.
3. **Run Terraform** with the new tfvars file:
   ```sh
   terraform plan -var-file=workspace-tfvars/prod-app-L-sci.tfvars
   terraform apply -var-file=workspace-tfvars/prod-app-L-sci.tfvars
   ```
